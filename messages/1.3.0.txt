Find-In-Files add-on 1.3.0
---------------------------

☝️

`ctrl+enter` will now open a preview, side-by-side.  The preview will update
when you navigate around (using e.g. `,` and `.`).

Both, `enter` and `ctrl+enter` will close the preview.

As there is no side-by-side to a results _panel_, this will only work for result
buffers.  Also: if you already use the newish "find_in_files_side_by_side" setting,
there is no real difference as you already opted-in to always use a side-by-side
view.  (Hint: Turn `find_in_files_side_by_side` off and use the preview feature
here.)
